## Problems in the Hardware Design

All of our designs are open-source! Please help us make it better.

* Our board design files are contained in the [`Hardware` folder](https://github.com/sparkfun/SparkFun_Spectral_Sensor_Breakout_AS7343_Qwiic/tree/main/Hardware) of the [Spectral Sensor Breakout - AS7343 (Qwiic) repository](https://github.com/sparkfun/SparkFun_Spectral_Sensor_Breakout_AS7343_Qwiic).

### Does something not make sense? ü§î

If part of the design is confusing, please [open an issue](https://github.com/sparkfun/SparkFun_Spectral_Sensor_Breakout_AS7343_Qwiic/issues) and let us know.

### Did we forget to include an important function of the board? ü§¶

If part of the board's functionality is missing, please [open an issue](https://github.com/sparkfun/SparkFun_Spectral_Sensor_Breakout_AS7343_Qwiic/issues) and file a feature request.

!!! tip "Design Considerations"
	Please keep in mind that we may intentionally exclude certain functions of the board to meet our product design requirements.
	
	* *For example, our Qwiic Micro boards are intended to fit on a small board layout and only use I<sup>2</sup>C communication; therefore, we may not have the SPI and interrupt pins available for users.*


### Do you wish to contribute directly to improving the board design?

1. With a GitHub account, [fork this repository](https://github.com/sparkfun/SparkFun_Spectral_Sensor_Breakout_AS7343_Qwiic/fork).
2. Add your design augmentation(s)
3. File a pull request with your changes, and enjoy making the ~~words~~ ~~worlds~~ world a better place.
	1. Once received, the engineer in charge of the original design will automatically be notified.
	2. We will review your suggested improvement(s) to verify that they are within our board design standards and meet our product design requirements.
	3. If approved, we will flag these changes for our next board revision. Congrats! üçª
