The SparkFun AS7343 Arduino Library helps users get started with the AS7343 with seven examples that go through how to use different features of the AS7343. The library is built around the [SparkFun Arduino Toolkit]() and requires installation of both libraries to work. Install the libraries using the [Arduino library manager]() by opening the tool and searching for "SparkFun Toolkit" and "SparkFun AS7343" and installing the latest releases of both libraries. Users who prefer to manually install the libraries can download ZIP files of them here: [SparkFun Toolkit (ZIP)]() and [SparkFun AS7343 Arduino Library (ZIP)]().
